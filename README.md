 The project goal is to generate a machine learning model that is trained to predict sepsis cases from clinical data.

 Data taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/the-nexus-of-sepsis/data

 # Dataset Description
 Three files are necessary for this competition,train.csv, test.csv, and submit.csv. The train.csv file includes about 1.09 million observations associated with 28,235 unique patients and over 3 dozen predictors before feature engineering.The test.csv file contains ~464K observations of 12,101 unique patients with the labels omitted. You will use the train.csv data to build and tune your models. You will forecast the test.csv file. Finally, you will use the sample_submission.csv to format your uploads. NOTE: the first column, ID, is the concatenation of the patient ID and the observation sequence. All submissions must have the exact labels and data of the sample_submission.csv.

 train.csv - the training set
 test.csv - the test set
 sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format
